# Human-Following

The provided codes are designed for a human following bot integrated using Raspberry Pi. The raspberry Pi will be mounted on a bot which would fetch data using a pi-camera on the bot and then it will tranfer the data to PC using Socket programming (by using Multi-threding) , so that all the processing stuff could be done on the PC.  

-> The file "humanFollowing_Final.py" contains the code for the image processing of a human body using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries and integrating these with the Server side code for the Socket to 
   run on the PC.
-> The other file should be integrated in the Raspberry Pi for the Client side of the Socket.
